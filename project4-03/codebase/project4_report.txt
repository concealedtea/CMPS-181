3. Index Nested Loop Join
- Describe how your Index Nested Loop Join works.
For each tuple from the outer (leftIn) relation, will extract the value used for condition and do:
inner->setIterator(value, value, true, true)
To get the matching tuples from the inner (rightIn) relation.


4. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
No

- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.

- Other implementation details:
Filter: For each tuple, extract the value used for condition and do the compare, if true then return the tuple.
Project: For each tuple, extract the desired values and use them to create the result tuple.
