2. Catalog information about Index
- Show your catalog information about an index (table, column, etc.). 

- Create catalog now sets up the indexes table with the above schema.
- Delete catalog now deletes the indexes table.
- Delete table now deletes the indexes from that table.

3. Index Nested-Loop Join
- Describe how your Index Nested-Loop Join works.

We get one row from the outer iterator, and then set up the index scan
so that it starts according to the conditon that was passed into the join.
Then we just iterate over the inner iterator, and concatenate the two rows.
A special case the NE_OP. We set up the inner iterator twice, once for the 
part of the file (strictly less than the value of the outer row), and once 
for the second part of the file (strictly greater than the value of the 
outer row). 

4. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?

We used the provided qe.cc and qe.h files. We implemented the filter directly
in the header, because the functions are really short, and the Projection and
INL in the .cc file.

- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.
